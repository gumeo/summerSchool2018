# Posters

## Instructions

Full participation in the summer school will give you 3.0 ECTS credits. Full participation requires the student to present a poster at the summer school. This includes:

- Bringing a poster (relevant to the summer school topic, preferably). Max. dimensions are 88cm wide x 126cm tall (A0 portrait).
- A poster teaser (1-2 slides, 1 minute) at the summer school. Rehears to make sure you are within the time limit.
- Presenting your poster at a designated poster session.

**The student is responsible for printing and bringing the poster. There is no poster printing available at the summer school location.**

Please send an email to Gudmundur Einarsson, [guei@dtu.dk](mailto:guei@dtu.dk), with the poster title, your poster (PDF format) and 1-2 teaser slides (PDF format) no later than August 1st (The subject should be **poster summer school 2018**). The poster will be put on the homepage and the poster teasers will be compiled and made ready for the summer school.

# Reading Material

The students are expected to go through some preparation before the summer school. Some more detailed content will come later. For now we recommend the introduction of the [CVX book](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) for those that want to brush up on the basics.
